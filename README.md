# STM32LL-SSD1306

STM32 library for working with OLEDs based on SSD1306, supports I2C, 4-wire SPI and emulated SPI.
Based on STM32Cube LL.
It also works with SH1106, SH1107 and SSD1309 which are compatible with SSD1306.

Rename `ssd1306_conf_template.h` to `ssd1306_conf.h` and configure.

The code is based on
[afiskon/stm32-ssd1306](https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1306) library.

## TODO

Implement I2C.
